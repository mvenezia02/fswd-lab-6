info on using sequelize
http://gregtrowbridge.com/getting-started-with-sequelize-and-the-sequelize-cli/
created new table "user"
  $ npm run sequelize -- model:create --name User --attributes name:string
git commit so can return to this point.

does sequelize discriminate when adding "s" to table name?
Yes! Added table "plurals" which sequelize inserted as "plurals" not "pluralss"

add new column to table "users"
  $ npm run sequelize migration:create
this created a migration file with a migration skeleton in it
for updating the model. Added to up function:
      return queryInterface.addColumn('Users', 'password', Sequelize.STRING);
and to the down function:
      return queryInterface.removeColumn('Users', 'password');
in real life, the password would be hashed and salted.

after updating the migration file, save it then run it from command line
  $ npm run sequelize db:migrate

then update the model file models/user.js
  password: DataTypes.STRING

then added guest/password to users from the command line:
      sqlite> insert into Users (name, password, createdAt, updatedAt)
      values ('guest','password', datetime('now'), datetime('now'));
